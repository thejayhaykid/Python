I went to the restaurant yesterday.  Hello, I said, to the man who 
greeted me at the door.  Where is your restroom?  On my way to the
restroom, I bumped into the waiter boy.  Excuse me, sir, I said.
When I returned to the table, the meal was served.  These are the
best clams I have ever eaten, I said.  My compliments to the chef.
Unfortunately, I was arrested by the officer for not paying my bill.
