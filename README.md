# Python

All of my code from college written in Python.

Maybe this could be a useful reference to someone out there, at least it will be a backup for me.

Please use this as a reference only, if for no other reason that you won't learn anything copying and pasting.

*Disclaimer*: I do not claim any of this code to be correct, this was added as is. I'll review pull requests but I do not have time to debug any issues myself.
